Hello and welcome to my personal website. I am a lecturer in machine learning at King’s College London. Before that, I spent four very memorable years as research fellow at Singapore University of Technology & Design hosted by Georgios Piliouras. I earned my PhD in game theory from the mathematics department of Athens University where I was very fortunate to be advised by Costis Melolidakis. My interests are in game theory, machine learning, artificial intelligence and cryptoeconomics.

**Contact details**: King’s College London, Department of Informatics, Bush House, Office S5.13. e-mail: stefanos.leonardos@kcl.ac.uk.

For students:

- **New!** Fully-funded PhD positions are now available at the Safe and Trusted AI CDT at King’s College London. Please contact me for further details if you are interested in “Learning emergent behaviors and mitigating critical phase transitions in AI and cryptoeconomic systems“.
- Office hours (January – March 2024): Mondays 16:00 – 17:00 @ Bush House S5.13. To avoid disappointment, please write an e-mail to me in advance to book a 15 minute slot if you intend to come. On Monday, March 25, office hours will be held online.
- PhD positions: If you are interested in doing research with me in game theory, multi-agent systems, learning in games, reinforcement learning and/or cryptoeconomics (mechanism design/incentives), there are a couple of opportunities to join our department with funded/self-funded PhD positions available, so please write to me.
